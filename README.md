This is a program to play games via Bluetooth using an ESP-32. It is designed around Minecraft's default binds, but the controls can be changed as needed.

## To-Do
- [x] Basic motion: strafing (buttons), looking around (joystick 1)
- [x] Advanced Motion: Run linear and translational motion simultaneously (look around while walking)
- [ ] Hardware-based Changes: Replace buttons with a second joystick, implement ABXY control with buttons, add other buttons (LT, RT, LB, RB)
- [ ] Optimization: Improve deadzones, turn speeds, and implement device naming functionality
- [ ] Make README more detailed
